"""
Basically, namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types.
They turn tuples into convenient containers for simple tasks.
With namedtuples, you donâ€™t have to use integer indices for accessing members of a tuple.


Dr. John Wesley has a spreadsheet containing a list of student's IDs , marks , class  and name.

Your task is to help Dr. Wesley calculate the average marks of the students.
